# BE-Creating-relations-Other-joins

Creating relations: Other joins
Instructions
In this practice problem, you will write JOIN queries to retrieve specified data from the songs table and the artists table. The tables have the following structures:

artists table
| artist_id | artist_name | genre_name |

songs table
| song_id | song_name | album_name | artist (FK)|

You will write your queries in the relevant SQL files to get the tests to pass.

Only one query should be written per file. Carefully check your syntax if you encounter errors. In particular, the names of the tables are very important because the automated tests depend on them to work properly. Only use aliases for specified fields.

Optional: Set up a database
This setup is optional, but if you would like a way to debug your queries, you can set up a database and connect it to DBeaver on your local machine. You can then execute any queries you write for this assessment and verify their outputs in DBeaver on your local machine.

If you have already set up DBeaver on your local machine to connect to an ElephantSQL-hosted database called thinkful_music_events for the previous lesson's assessment, then you can just use the same setup to test out your queries for this assessment. Otherwise, follow the steps below:

Set up a new instance called thinkful_music_events on ElephantSQL. The instructions for creating a new database instance can be found in the Creating and deleting databases lesson of the previous module.
Connect DBeaver to your database instance and rename the database connection to thinkful_music_events for easy reference. The instructions for connecting DBeaver to your instance can be found in the Installing DBeaver lesson of the previous module.
Now, you can execute your queries in DBeaver.
After creating all the tables described below, you can run the src/seed.sql script in DBeaver to seed your database. Then you can use the SELECT * FROM <table_name> command to retrieve the records from the tables and check that the tables were properly populated. As you're creating your queries for this assessment, you can execute your queries in DBeaver to see if they're retrieving the datasets properly.

test/	This folder has the tests your code will run against. You do not need to edit any of these files.
Tasks
Outer join queries
For each of the following files, create a query as described.

src/get-all-artists-and-songs.sql: Write a join query to return a list of all artists and their songs. Include the artist name, song title, and album name columns only in your result.

src/get-all-songs-and-artists.sql: Write a join query to return a list of all songs and their artists. Include the song name, album name, and artist name columns only in your result.

src/get-all-songs-and-all-artists.sql: Write a join query to return a list of all artists and all songs stored in the database. Include the artist name, song name, and album name columns only in your result. Alias the artist_name and album_name columns to artist and album, respectively.
